# Topological Data Analysis (TDA)

## The shape of data

* Usually, the data we are interested in is not randomly distributed in space,
but rather sampled from a lower-dimensional submanifold

TODO

## Persistent homology

* Capture the features of a space at various scales


TODO

# Hyperbolic embeddings

## Hyperbolic space
