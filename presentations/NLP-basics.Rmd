## NLP tasks

* Word-sense induction (WSI) or word-sense discrimination: identification of the senses/meanings of a word
  * output: clustering of contexts of the target word, or a clustering of words related to the target word
* Word-sense disambiguation (WSD): relies on a predefined sense inventory,
and the task is to solve the ambiguity in the context, i.e. identifying which sense of a word is used in a sentence

TODO

## Word-sense disambiguation

* WordNet as a reference sense inventory for English language
* WordNet encodes concepts as synonym sets

* SemEval: international word sense disambiguation competition
* approaches: knowledge-based, supervised, and unsupervised

TODO

## Part-of-speech tagging

* grammatical tagging: decide which part of speech
(noun, verb, article, adjective, preposition, pronoun, adverb, conjunction, and interjection)
in a text/corpus belongs to
* this might depend both on the definition of the word and its context, and in language
a large portion of word-forms are ambiguous
  * Example from wikipedia: "dogs" usually is a plural noun, but can also be a verb as in the sentence
  "The sailor dogs the hatch."
* sub-categories:
  * for nouns, the plural, possessive, and singular forms can be distinguished.
  * "case" (role as subject, object, etc.), grammatical gender, and so on
  * while verbs are marked for tense, aspect, and other things

## Benchmarks

* General Language Understanding Evaluation [(GLUE)](https://gluebenchmark.com/)
 benchmark
* Winograd schema challenge (WSC)
  * "The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they [feared/advocated] violence."
